# Fitted-Q-Iteration-via-Max-Plus-Linear-Approximation
The repository is intended for the numerical simulation of the paper titled Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation which can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08422.
The code is fitted with GPU compatibility thanks to JAX

> :warning: Under Development
A wrapper of the function will be made available after the revision of this submission. 

# Usage

```
python3 data_gen.py
```
to generate the data

```
python3 run_experiemt.py
```
to run the experiment with different sizes, basis functions, and any of the three algorithms
